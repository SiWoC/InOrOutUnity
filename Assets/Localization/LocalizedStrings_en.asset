    m_Localized: 'The game:

      There is one outsider, the rest are insiders.

      The
      outsider wants to join the conversation, but the insiders don''t want the outsider
      to know what they''re talking about.

      The insiders need to figure out
      who the outsider is.

      The outsider wants to figure out what the insiders
      are talking about.


      The game selects a set of two words that are somewhat
      related to the same topic.

      The game chooses an outsider.

      Pass
      the app to the player indicated by the game and look at your word without other
      players seeing it.


      Pass the app to the player indicated by the game
      and enter a first word that you associate with the word you''ve seen. Whether
      specific or not, what information are you giving to the outsider? Or are you
      perhaps the outsider yourself?


      The game shows all first words and players
      look if they can determine anything from them. Why did you enter that? What
      does that mean?


      After a while, players think they know enough and a
      second round begins, everyone enters a second word.

      A second discussion
      round follows.


      Then everyone enters who they think the outsider is.

      A
      final discussion round follows.

      The players try to agree on who the
      outsider is and the outsider tries to guess what the insiders were talking
      about.


      And?

      Were you right?

      Or were you perhaps the outsider
      without knowing it.


      Keep score?

      Ah, is that really important?
      You know you''re the best anyway!'
