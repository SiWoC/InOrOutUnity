      wants to join the conversation, but the insiders don\u2019t want the outsider
      to know what they\u2019re talking about.\nThe insiders need to figure out who
      the outsider is.\nThe outsider wants to figure out what the insiders are talking
      about.\n\nThe game is played on a single device that is passed to the next
      player each time.\nAt the start, the game selects a set of two words that are
      somewhat related to the same topic.\nThe game chooses an outsider.\n\nThe setup
      round begins.\nPass the device to the player indicated by the game, and that
      player looks at their word without the other players seeing it.\n\nThe first
      round begins.\nPass the device again to the player indicated by the game, and
      that player enters a first word that they associate with the word they saw.
      Whether specific or not, what information are they giving to the outsider?
      Or are they perhaps the outsider themself?\n\nA first discussion round follows.\nThe
      game shows all the first words, and the players see if they can figure anything
      out. Why did you enter that? What does that mean?\n\nAfter a while, the players
      think they know enough and a second round begins: everyone enters a second
      word.\nA second discussion round follows.\n\nThen everyone enters who they
      think the outsider is.\nA final discussion round follows.\nThe players see
      if they can agree on who the outsider is, and the outsider tries to guess what
      the insiders were talking about.\n\nAnd?\nWere you right?\nOr were you perhaps
      the outsider without knowing it?\n\nKeep score?\nAh, is that really important?
      You know you\u2019re the best anyway!"
